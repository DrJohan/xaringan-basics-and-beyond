# Special considerations

[NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/about/) | [NHS-R Virtual Conference 2020](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/nhs-r-virtual-conference-2020-tickets-116861085653)
  
  > The **NHS-R Community** is running its third conference virtually during the first two weeks of November. We will have a diverse range of speakers and interactive discussions about the use of R within your organisation.

  > **Monday 2nd November - Friday 6th November**: Series of Introduction to R training, including basics of R, ggplot2 and Markdown.
  
  > **Monday 9th of November - Friday 13th November**: Main Conference Events. This will include more workshops, lightning talks and plenary sessions. 

The Conference Committee prefers instructors to use RStudio Cloud: 

> The Rstudio cloud came to our mind because some of the NHS organisations have troubles installing Rstudio to their working laptops (I know, it is hard to believe, but the software policy in the public sector in the UK is not perfect)

.pull-left[
**Day 1: The Basics**

1. What is xaringan? Benefits?
1. How to create a xaringan presentation using [this!] custom NHS template
1. What files does the template create in directory (only the necessary ones)?
1. What is in the YAML?
1. What are the building blocks (new slide, incremental slides, presenter notes, headings)?
1. What kind of content can be displayed (text, images, code, plots, tables, maps, gt tables)?
1. How can content be displayed on the slide (alignment of entire slide vs. specific content)
1. How can we change the appearance with themes?
1. Once we're ready, how to deploy (GitHub pages, Netlify as backup)?

]

.pull-right[
**Day 2: The Beyond**

1. What are our options for presenting? Introduce some choice xaringanExtra features
1. Why would we want to experiment with CSS? How is CSS useful in other contexts (website design, blog posts, Shiny apps)
1. How can we make sense of the `default.css` and `default-fonts.css` files?
1. Where can we find colors and how do we consider accessibility in our choices?
1. Where can we find fonts?
1. How can we make our own template slide classes like `title-slide` or `about-me`?
1. Additional resources! (for less and more CSS control)
